I've been searching extensively for a service that allows sending ERC-20 tokens on the Monad testnet to multiple wallets in a single transaction, but I couldn't find one.
That's why I created this service, with significant help from AI. You can use this service to easily send ERC-20 tokens on the Monad testnet to multiple wallets. It supports all Kuru Exchange and Naddotfun tokens.
